## "Yes We Can": Four versions of the exercise

This repository contains the exercise described in Ball, R. (2023). “Yes We Can!”: A Practical Approach to Teaching Reproducibility to Undergraduates  . Harvard Data Science Review, 5(3). https://doi.org/10.1162/99608f92.9e002f7b


All materials are stored in one zipped folder "YesWeCan.zip".

There are three "flavors" of the exercise, which differ in (i) the type of software used and (ii) the method used to manage the working directory:
  1) Stata software; manual management of the working directory.
  2) R and RStudio; manual management of the working directory.
  3) R and RStudio; creating an RStudio project to manage the working directory. 

For each flavor, there are four versions.  As described in the paper, these four versions differ in the extent to which they incorporate methods that enhance reproducibility.
  1) Interactive and non-reproducible.
  2) Scripts, the project folder, and the working directory.
  3) Saving output.
  4) The reproducibility trifecta. 

There are consequently twelve "instances" of the exercise (three flavors times four versions).

For every instance of the exercise, the materials posted here include:
  1) A pdf document with instructions for students.
  2) A sample solution--i.e., a folder containing a copy of the work students would submit (including a report, and the additional code and output required for each instance).
